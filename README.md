# typescript-against-humanity
A Cards Against Humanity clone made in typescript

I was looking for a good online version of cards against humanity but i could not find one so i made my own

Most of the packs where copied from either https://github.com/amirrajan/nodejs-against-humanity or https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy
